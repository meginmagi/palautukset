Code smells by Adrian.

Code smells are unnecessarily messy bits of code that can jeopardize the functionality, security, stability
and general performance of a program, webpage, function or other computer software where it appears as well
as make working on the code itself difficult for human beings when attempting to correct said smelly parts.

A logical, methodical and practical approach with written guidelines and memos are what will
protect a programmer from themselves and help create a functional, simpler program which won't require
days/weeks/months for another programmer or the original programmer to fix.

All it takes is a few comments and the merging of similar functions while getting rid of redundant ones.

Sounds easy, right? It is easy if you avoid them completely from the start.
